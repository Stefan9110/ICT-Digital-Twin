\textbf{RQ3} \label{question:rq3} &

% Question
\textbf{How to evaluate experimentally, through a prototype, that the design of this system actually meets the goals?}
\\&

% Description
In order for any system to be deemed successful and complete, it must be first be evaluated by experts in its related field.
We aim to deliver a prototype of the datacenter simulation service and evaluate it through a series of experiments.
The purpose of this research question is to determine the best way to evaluate the system, to ensure that it meets the goals of its stakeholders, on both a functional and non-functional level.
Furthermore, the system must deliver reliable results to both small and large-scale datacenter operators.
