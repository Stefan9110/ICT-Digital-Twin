% Question
\textbf{How to offer a datacenter simulation tool as \textit{Software as a Service}, as well as \textit{Platform as a Service}?}
\\&

% Description
There is a current lack of adaptability of datacenter simulation tools, mainly due to problems related to accessibility, reliability and scalability.
The aim of this research question is to determine the functional and non-functional requirements of a datacenter simulation service.
The trade-off between usability and functionality must be carefully analyzed to ensure a reliable and accessible service.
We also aim to identify the best practices for offering such a service, as well as the potential challenges that may arise.
