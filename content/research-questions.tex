\section{Research Questions} \label{sec:research-questions}

By evaluating the problem we conclude that it can be separated into three main research questions.

    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
        \textbf{RQ1} & \textbf{How to offer a datacenter simulation tool as \textit{Software as a Service}, as well as \textit{Platform as a Service}?} \\
        & There is a current lack of adaptability of datacenter simulation tools, mainly due to problems related to accessibility, reliability and scalability.
        The aim of this research question is to determine the functional and non-functional requirements of a datacenter simulation service.
        The trade-off between usability and functionality must be carefully analyzed to ensure a reliable and accessible service.
        We also aim to identify the best practices for offering such a service, as well as the potential challenges that may arise.
        \\\\

        \textbf{RQ2} & \textbf{How to design the backend for a datacenter simulation service and under what policies?} \\
        & In order for a reliable and scalable simulation tool to function properly, a solid foundation must be established.
        We aim to determine the parameters that quantify the performance of the backend of a datacenter simulation service.
        Through these parameters, we can determine which policies are best suited for the backend of the tool.
        \\\\

        \textbf{RQ3} & \textbf{How to evaluate experimentally, through a prototype, that the design of this system actually meets the goals?} \\
        & In order for any system to be deemed successful and complete, it must be first be evaluated by experts in its related field.
        We aim to deliver a prototype of the datacenter simulation service and evaluate it through a series of experiments.
        The purpose of this research question is to determine the best way to evaluate the system, to ensure that it meets the goals of its stakeholders, on both a functional and non-functional level.
        Furthermore, the system must deliver reliable results to both small and large-scale datacenter operators.
