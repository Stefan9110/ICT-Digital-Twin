// TO-DO

Possible research questions discussed

How to offer such a service as SaaS (users use this as complete software) 
but also PaaS (users program). For the latter case, how to offer a simpler
programming interface?

How to design the backend for such a service? What architecture and which
components? What policies?

How to evaluate experimentally, through a prototype, that the design of this
system actually meets the goals?
