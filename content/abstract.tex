Datacenter infrastructure has become a fundamental building block of our modern society. The rate of cloud adoption surpasses 90\% within economic institutions, while government and public educational entities exhibit a 65\% adoption rate \cite{iosup2022future}.
Furthermore, in the Dutch digital economy, every €1 invested in the ICT infrastructure generates a notably higher added value of €15, which is projected to reach €22 by 2025.

Simulation constitutes an indispensable element in the process of operating a datacenter. It facilitates the conduct of scalable experiments involving millions of tasks and hundreds of thousands of computations, as well as the execution of what-if analyses within a time frame spanning minutes to hours \cite{DBLP:conf/ccgrid/MastenbroekAI+21}, forever changing the way we design ICT infrastructure. However, integrating simulation tools into a natural workflow may pose a considerable challenge for any entity willing to manage a datacenter without a preexisting technical proficiency.
\\\\
This paper aims to create a solution to this outstanding concern, by evaluating an ICT digital twin as a service. The objective of this work is to provide readily accessible means for any individual or organization to conduct analysis, automation, and optimization of the datacenter design process via simulation software, with the intent of minimizing the required technical expertise.
