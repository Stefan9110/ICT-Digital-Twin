\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
% Use much more general terms 
% Present the same problem, but emphasizing the lack of available resources

Currently, operating simulation software demands a high degree of technical expertise.
An entity willing to use such software at an advanced level would require (some \ldots describe) technical knowledge.

\subsection{Describing in very technical, specific terms}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic understanding of \textit{Maven} artifacts and the ability to use a \textit{Gradle} wrapper to compile and publish the OpenDC code base as a local repository, ready to be used as an API.
    \item Ability to read Kotlin source code and a good understanding of the OpenDC code base, in order to create a meaningful simulation.
    \item Ability to write Kotlin or Java code, compile it, and understand possible error messages.
    \item Basic understanding of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and how it runs locally.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Describing in more general terms}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Familiarity with software development principles and practices.
    \item Understanding of how to use and interact with APIs.
    \item Knowledge of how to troubleshoot and debug code.
\end{enumerate}
