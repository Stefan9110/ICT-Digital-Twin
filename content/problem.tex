\section{Problem} \label{sec:problem}

% 3 problems:
% 1. Lack of adaptability of current datacenter simulation tools
% 2. Need for a reliable and user-friendly datacenter simulation tool
% 3. Need for a large-scale service aimed for expert datacenter operators

In this report, we identify and aim to address three main problems in the field of datacenter simulation.
Firstly, most datacenter architects do not currently adapt simulation tools in their practice.
Thus, we identify \textbf{a lack of adaptability of simulation tools} in the field of datacenter design.
Secondly, currently available datacenter simulation tools are still under development or have not reached a maturity level to enable them to be used \textit{as a service}.
We observe \textbf{the need for a reliable and accessible datacenter simulation service} that can be used by non-experts in the field of datacenter design and operation.
Finally, operating a simulation service should be scalable for larger datacenter operators and novice users alike.
Therefore, we identify \textbf{the need for a scalable service}, that can handle both complex operations at a reasonable cost and deliver fast and reliable results.
