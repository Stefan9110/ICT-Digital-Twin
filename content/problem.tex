\section{Problem}
% Use much more general terms 
% Present the same problem, but emphasizing the lack of available resources
Currently, operating simulation software such as OpenDC demands a high degree of technical expertise. An entity willing to use such software at an advanced level would require the following technical knowledge:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basic understanding of \textit{Maven} artifacts and the ability to use a \textit{Gradle} wrapper to compile and publish the OpenDC code base as a local repository, ready to be used as an API.
    \item Ability to read Kotlin source code and a good understanding of the OpenDC code base, in order to create a meaningful simulation.
    \item Ability to write Kotlin or Java code, compile it, and understand possible error messages.
    \item Basic understanding of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and how it runs locally.
\end{enumerate}
These challenges stem from the absence of an advanced user interface within OpenDC. Albeit the web application offers an interactive gateway to access simulation features, it is notably constrained in its functionality. Furthermore, the minimal documentation available makes it notably harder for an individual to begin using OpenDC, even in the context of previous programming experience.

This work seeks to establish an accessible mean for any organization to utilize simulation software, integrating both a programming interface and a graphical user interface.
